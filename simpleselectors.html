        <pre>Project Name : Development of a modified knn Algorithm for effective segmentation of mammographic images
Description :
Environment : jupyternotebook ,AndroidStudio ,Languages/Database: Python,ML
TeamSize:2
This project develops a modified KNN algorithm to enhance mammographic image segmentation for early breast cancer detection.
It addresses the limitations of traditional KNN by incorporating noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and spatial information.
Preprocessing steps optimize input data for better segmentation of breast tissue and tumor areas. The improved algorithm 
outperforms traditional KNN in segmenting key regions. The goal is to aid radiologists in detecting early-stage breast cancer,
leading to better diagnostic outcomes.
